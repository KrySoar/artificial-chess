        <h3>Welcome to my upcoming website! Get ready for an exciting chess experience. Challenge our diverse Artificial Intelligence opponents, including the well-known ChatGPT (Bard and Claude coming later too). You can also play against classical chess engines like Stockfish or Maia Chess (which offers a more human-like playing style). While the general AIs might not match the power and precision of classical chess engines, their unique approach promises a refreshing and fun gaming experience. Stay tuned !<h3>
